# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Overview
This project uses the Kaggle Titanic dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts passenger survival.  
The workflow includes **data exploration, feature engineering, and model training with scikit-learn**.  
The project is still in progress — additional experiments, hyperparameter tuning, and final Kaggle submission will be added later.  

⚠️ **Note:** This repository is under active maintenance. Code, notebooks, and results will be gradually updated.
